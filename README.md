# Dart Practice â€“ Introduction to Flutter Course

## Overview
This repository contains my Dart practice exercises completed as part of the introduction to Flutter course.
The goal of this practice was to strengthen my understanding of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), data structures, and parameter types in Dart before moving on to full Flutter app development.

## Topics Covered
* Object-Oriented Programming (classes, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation)
* Data Structures (lists, maps, sets)
* Parameter Types (named, optional, required, positional)
